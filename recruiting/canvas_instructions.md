# Canvas Recruiting

Hey! Thanks for helping us collect emails. This will take around 5 minutes per class.

Check this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lSrrHcgt_5UpUJpAE4KqYf8afYyY8yeqF2IwgIdoEMg/edit#gid=1692144881) for classes that we still need emails from. It'd be great if you could sign up for any classes you've taken. Here are the instructions:

1. Add the [Save as MHTML extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-as-mhtml/ahgakckdonjmnpnegjcamhagackmjpei/related?hl=en). You can uninstall it after.

2. Go to your class on Canvas and find the "People" page.

3. **Scroll down** to the **bottom**, making sure that every name is loaded.

4. Hit the Save as MHTML extension. A ``.mhtml`` version of the site should download. Rename the file in the format "semester_class", e.g. ``fa20_stat20.mhtml``.

5. Upload the file at this [Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bSB4TCswGV5WMLQbOMRL9Fh981_JkagW?usp=sharing).

That's it! Thanks a ton.
